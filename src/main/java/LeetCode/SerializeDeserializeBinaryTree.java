/**
 * Serialization is the process of converting a data structure or object into a sequence of bits
 * so that it can be stored in a file or memory buffer, or transmitted across a network connection
 * link to be reconstructed later in the same or another computer environment.
 * <p>
 * Design an algorithm to serialize and deserialize a binary tree. There is no restriction on
 * how your serialization/deserialization algorithm should work. You just need to ensure that a
 * binary tree can be serialized to a string and this string can be deserialized to the original tree structure.
 * <p>
 * For example, you may serialize the following tree
 * <p>
 * .    1
 * .   / \
 * .  2   3
 * .     / \
 * .    4   5
 * as "[1,2,3,null,null,4,5]", just the same as how LeetCode OJ serializes a binary tree. You do not necessarily need to follow this format, so please be creative and come up with different approaches yourself.
 * <p>
 * Print the tree in pre-order traversal and use "X" to denote null node and split node with ",".
 * We can use a StringBuilder for building the string on the fly.
 * For de-serializing, we use a Queue to store the pre-order traversal and since we have "X" as null node,
 * we know exactly how to where to end building sub-tress.
