/**
 * Problem
 * Implement a Java Iterable object that iterates lines one by one from a text file.
 * The candidate might well ask:
 * should the Iterator implement remove? A: no.
 * what should happen when an IOException occurs? A: throw an unchecked exception, of your choice.
 * what's Iterable? A: it's a little interface that simply declares the iterator() method, for example
 * java.util.List.iterator() and Set.iterator().
 * Common mistakes include:
 * attempting to read the entire file into memory. Ask the candidate to avoid this (which will require handling in version of control).
 * failing to close the FileReader when the iterator has been exhausted (which leaks a file descriptor).
 * incorrectly handling an empty file (in which case BufferedReader.readLine returns null immediately).
 * trying to re-implementBufferedReader. If they don't know about this class, give them a brief introduction or perhaps abandon this question.
 * creating the BufferedReader in the TextFile constructor instead of the Iterator implementation
 * Suggested hints:
 * Feel free to point candidates at the Javadoc for java.io.* there isn't any reason to expect them to know that off
 * the top of their head. Also, feel free to point them to the relevant classes if they describe what they want.
 * As with many of our iterator questions, reading the entire file at the beginning is an acceptable starting point for
 * them to improve on. If they are having trouble starting, you can guide them to that before asking for the line by line implementation.
